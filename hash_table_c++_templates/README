Intro:
    This is an implementation of HashTable with Get/Put/Remove. 
    This implementation assumes, user owned storage of string (pointers)
    Note: Hash adjusts the size as necessary. Compact/Resize can be
    explcitly invoked. Or it is triggered while doing Put(). [ Remove()
    does not trigger a Resize() ]


TO MAKE: 
    make ( or make exe)

TO RUN:
    ./exe 
    ./exe tests/1inp 
    ./exe tests/2inp
    

MANIFEST:

    hash.h : template class HashTable resides here
    hash_use.cxx : has main() function, driver function, Test harnesses etc
    Makefile: 
    
    tests:
        1inp: simple
        2inp: a more complex test that showcases **expansion** and
	      **compaction** of HashTable
	OUTPUT.2inp: sample output file with annotations

Command File Syntax:
P str val : Hash.Put(str,val)
D         : Print HashTable
G str     : Hash.Get(str, INOUT val)
T level   : set trace level
R str     : Hash.Remove(str)
C         : try to Compact/Resize/Expand
